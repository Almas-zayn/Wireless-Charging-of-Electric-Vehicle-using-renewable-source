# Wireless-Charging-of-Electric-Vehicle-using-renewable-source
Developed a wireless charging system for electric vehicles using renewable energy, integrating transmitting and receiving copper coils for efficient power transfer.
Programmed and utilized two PIC microcontrollers, one in the charging station and one in the vehicle, for coordinated operation of charging systems.
Built a remote-controlled vehicle prototype, powered by motors, to simulate real-world electric vehicle functionalities.
Integrated renewable energy sources to power the charging station, emphasizing sustainability in EV infrastructure.
Tested and validated the system, ensuring effective communication between microcontrollers and achieving reliable wireless charging performance.
Used Inverters to convert DC to AC to transmit HF current in Transmitting coil and Rectifiers to convert AC to DC.
